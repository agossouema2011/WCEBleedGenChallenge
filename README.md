<b>Notes:</b>
- Our github code is made of two folders "Classification" and "Detection".
- All the model weight and plots for classification are saved in sub folder "outputs" in "Classification" folder.
- All the model weight and plots for detection are saved in sub folder "outputs" in Detection folder.


<b>1• A table of the achieved evaluation metrics of validation dataset</b>
   <b>Classification: Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score </b>


   <b>Detection: Average Precision, Mean-Average Precision, Intersection over Union(IoU))</b>


<b>2• Screenshots/pictures of any 10 best images selected from validation dataset showing its classification and detection (bounding box with confidence level)</b>



<b>3• Screenshots/ pictures of achieved interpretability plot of any 10 best images selected from validation dataset</b>



<b>4• Screenshots/pictures of any 5 best images selected from testing dataset 1 and 2 separately showing its classification and detection (bounding box with confidence level)</b>



<b>5• Screenshots/ pictures of achieved interpretability plot of any 5 best images selected from testing dataset 1 and 2 separately</b>
