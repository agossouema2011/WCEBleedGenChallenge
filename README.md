<b>Notes:</b>
- Our github code is made of two folders "Classification" and "Detection".
- All the model weight and plots for classification are saved in sub folder "outputs" in "Classification" folder.
- All the model weight and plots for detection are saved in sub folder "outputs" in Detection folder.


1• A table of the achieved evaluation metrics of validation dataset
   Classification: Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score 


   Detection: Average Precision, Mean-Average Precision, Intersection over Union(IoU))


2• Screenshots/pictures of any 10 best images selected from validation dataset showing its classification and detection (bounding box with confidence level).



3• Screenshots/ pictures of achieved interpretability plot of any 10 best images selected from validation dataset.



4• Screenshots/pictures of any 5 best images selected from testing dataset 1 and 2 separately showing its classification and detection (bounding box with confidence level).




5• Screenshots/ pictures of achieved interpretability plot of any 5 best images selected from testing dataset 1 and 2 separately.
